# About
Welcome. Thank you for visiting the Rosslyn Farms Community Club (the Club) website. For almost 120 years, the Club has enriched the community by developing social, educational, and civic interests. Our various committees work hard throughout the year to bring beauty and laughter to Rosslyn Farms for those of all ages.

Rosslyn Farms is a suburban borough conveniently located 5 miles west of Pittsburgh and 10 miles east of the Pittsburgh International Airport. Our small community consists of 193 unique stone, stucco, and brick homes. The population was 427 at the 2010 census. Rosslyn Farms boasts a community park, swimming pool, soccer fields, and tennis courts. We also have a community center with a large gathering room and gymnasium.

Originally known as “Uncertainty,” the tract of land that is now Rosslyn Farms was warranted to James Bell in 1788. Named in honor of Roslin, Scotland, Rosslyn Farms was founded in 1902 by the Chartiers Land Company and developed and built by its Mr. William Parrish. Mr. Parrish’s descendants still live here today.
